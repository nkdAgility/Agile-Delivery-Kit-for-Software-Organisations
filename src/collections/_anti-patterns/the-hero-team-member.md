The Hero takes it upon him or herself to be the saviour. Heroes will often close themselves off to communication with other Team members and hoard work. Heroes often are dismissive of Scrum, because it removes individuals from the spotlight and instead focuses attention and accountability on the Team. Heroes justify their actions by claiming that they are doing what it takes to be successful.

Examples of the Hero Behaviour

- Failure to elaborate on how their work is progressing or what they are doing
- Claiming he or she alone is capable of performing specific work
- Favouring generalities over specifics when discussing anything of substance
- Harsh criticism directed toward others who may draw attention away from the hero

## Typical impact

- The Team may actually rely on the Hero, allowing this vocal person to drive outcomes
- Trust on the Team dissolves as Team members become divested of ownership
- Quality suffers as the Hero does not actually meet the Team’s Definition of Done, offering convincing arguments as to why this doesn’t matter
