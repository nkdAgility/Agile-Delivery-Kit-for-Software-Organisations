## Description

Most organisations are unwilling to change the systems that are finely tuned to maintain the status quo.

They bring in agile frameworks and practices and layer them on top of the existing systems. The practice of layering new systems on top of the old systems are why organisations are not seeing the expected benefits from agile. The only way to fix this is to challenge the systems and change them. That is why Scrum has a Scrum Master that is charged with the teams effectiveness.

## Symptoms

 - No real change as core differences of new systems (Scrum, Kanban, Lean, etc...) are ignored
 - Increased frustration as new systems interact with existing ones

## Actions

- Get stakeholder buyin for new system.
- Run [OpenSpace Agile](../_technologies/openspace-agile.md) or OpenSpace Beta to bring everyone on board.
