It is important for all participants and stakeholders to understand an organization's strategic goals and how their work contributes to achieving them. This alignment leads to focused efforts, efficient resource utilization, and better decision-making. Understanding the organization's objectives also motivates participants and stakeholders, leading to a greater sense of ownership, accountability, and commitment to achieving the goals.

## The Importance of Goals

It is essential for all participants and stakeholders to understand the overall strategic goals of an organization because it provides a clear direction for everyone involved. When everyone is aware of the organization's objectives and the role they play in achieving them, they can align their work towards the same goals. This alignment helps to ensure that all efforts are focused on the most critical tasks, and that resources are used effectively.

Furthermore, when participants and stakeholders can see how their work contributes to the organization's strategic goals, they are more motivated and engaged in their work. They have a sense of purpose and understand the impact of their work on the organization's success. This understanding can lead to a greater sense of ownership, accountability, and commitment to achieving the goals.

In addition, having a clear understanding of the organization's strategic goals and how their work contributes to it, can facilitate better decision-making. Participants and stakeholders can make informed decisions that align with the organization's objectives and overall strategy.

Overall, ensuring that all participants and stakeholders understand the overall strategic goals and can see how their work contributes to it is a crucial component of successful organizorganisations.
