From the perspective of Scrum the idea of Ready, as applied to a Backlog Item, represents everyone's (Developers, Product Owner, & Stakeholders) understanding of what is needed to implement that Backlog Item. Since this is subjective and not objective having a defenition of what consitutes ready is not posible.

The danger of having a defined Defenition of Ready (DoR) is two fold:

* **False sense of Ready** - First that it creates a false sense of Ready that encompases the ojective points that we can focus on, but misses the subjective. This can lead to false gating where participants hold each other acountable for failing to achieve somethign that was not defigned in the first place.
* **False Equivelence with DoD** - Using the DoR terminology generally leads participants to feel that the DoD and the DoR have an equivlence. This is dangerious as the DoD is an absolute boolean proposition while the subjective natire of the DoR may lead it to be only partially impleemnted. If its OK to only partially achieve the DoR the logial falocy is that the DoD can also be partially implemntd.

A solution that may enable the effective use of this practice may be to a diferent formula of naming to create disambiguation between the DoR and the DoD.


## Backlog Candicacy Test

Every candidate Backlog Item should have:

* Backlog Item has a clear outcome or objective
* Backlog Item contains a clear hypothosis
* Backlog item defigned clear telemitery to be collected
* Backlog

Once candiacy is achieved then the Team & Stakehodlers can determin Ready with conversation.



**WARNING: Definition of Ready can result in significant anti-patterns in teams.**

_As a general rule Developers should not take Backlog Item into a Sprint that they do not fully understand and agree, as a team, that there is a reasonable likelihood of being successful._

A Definition of Ready often results in a lack of refinement with the Scrum Team and thus a lack of understanding of the Backlog Items. Refer to the [Backlog Item Format](/Project-Management/Agile-Ways-of-Working/Complementary-Practices/Writing-Backlog-Items) that you have chosen for what might be contained within it. If you MUST have a DoR then consider:

- I (Independent). The PBI should be self-contained and it should be possible to bring it into progress without a dependency upon another PBI or an external resource.
- N (Negotiable). A good PBI should leave room for discussion regarding its optimal implementation.
- V (Valuable). The value a PBI delivers to stakeholders should be clear.
- E (Estimable). A PBI must have a size relative to other PBIs.
- S (Small). PBIs should be small enough to estimate with reasonable accuracy and to plan into a time-box such as a Sprint.
- T (Testable). Each PBI should have clear acceptance criteria which allow its satisfaction to be tested.
