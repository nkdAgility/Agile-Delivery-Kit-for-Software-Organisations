**WARNING: Definition of Ready can result in significant anti-patterns in teams.** 

_As a general rule Developers should not take Backlog Item into a Sprint that they do not fully understand and agree, as a team, that there is a reasonable likelihood of being successful._

A Definition of Ready often results in a lack of refinement with the Scrum Team and thus a lack of understanding of the Backlog Items. Refer to the [Backlog Item Format](/Project-Management/Agile-Ways-of-Working/Complementary-Practices/Writing-Backlog-Items) that you have chosen for what might be contained within it. If you MUST have a DoR then consider:

- I (Independent). The PBI should be self-contained and it should be possible to bring it into progress without a dependency upon another PBI or an external resource.
- N (Negotiable). A good PBI should leave room for discussion regarding its optimal implementation.
- V (Valuable). The value a PBI delivers to stakeholders should be clear.
- E (Estimable). A PBI must have a size relative to other PBIs.
- S (Small). PBIs should be small enough to estimate with reasonable accuracy and to plan into a time-box such as a Sprint.
- T (Testable). Each PBI should have clear acceptance criteria which allow its satisfaction to be tested.
