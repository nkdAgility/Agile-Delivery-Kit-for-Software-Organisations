## Question

Does having a definition of ready a good idea?

## Short Answer

No. Having a definition of ready can lead to gating of work for a team.

## Long Answer

In the Scrum Guide there is the idea of "ready" that is associated with the [Product Backlog](../_guides/scrum-guide.md#product-backlog).

This reflects the shared understand that is necessary for a Scrum Team to take on work.

While the intent behind a definition of ready is laudable the outcome is mostly an "us vs them" attitude between the Developers and the Stakeholders, or worse the Product Owner. Rather than having a checklist, definition of ready, or DOD, just get the Scrum Team together and come to an agreement of which items in the Backlog are "ready" for us to attempt.
