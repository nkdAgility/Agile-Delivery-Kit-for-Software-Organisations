## Question

Should a Scrum Master be as knowledgeable as a Product Owner?

## Answer

In the Scrum Masters service to the Product Owner they should have deep expertise in product management, but don't need deep expertise in the product.

The Scrum Master will benefit from some knowledge of how the product works and how its architected as they coach the Scrum Team to being as effective as they can be at delivering value, but it is not expected that they will have deep knowledge of the product domain.

The Scrum Master will need to have deep knowledge of product discovery and delivery in general to allow them to coach the Product Owner and help the Scrum Team find better ways of delivering their product.
