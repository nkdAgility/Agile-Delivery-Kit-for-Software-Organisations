These are the core first principals by which this document operates and they are routed in empiricism:

- Continuous delivery of valuable product to at least some subset of real users every iteration (including the first) and gathering feedback
- All participants and stakeholders should understand the overall strategic goals and be able to see how the work contributes to it
- Update the work based on user feedback on timelines shorter than one month
- The work needed will emerge as we do the work and help others do it
- Processes, practices and tools necessary will emerge as we do the work and help others do it
