# NOTES

Duration

The Working Agreement would result in both a Statement of Work and agreement on how much agility will be applied to the work. Explicit and transparent options should be presented so that the customer clearly understands what they need to do for us to be successful.

While the working agreement should be run as a workshop

- New Signature Promises
  - Usable Increment - Unable Increment of every Sprint, including the first
  - Dedicated Team - Dedicated Team of Developers that can turn the requested value into a usable increment
- Customer promises to:
  - Provide a Product Owner: The customer will provide an individual with appropriate expertise and accountability to; develop and explicitly communicating the Product Goal; create and clearly communicate Product Backlog items; order Product Backlog items; and, Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.
  - Provide Goals – The customer commits to provide; a Product Vision as the Strategic goal, a Product Goal as an Intermediate Strategic Goal, and each sprint a Sprint Goal as an Intermediate Tactical Goal.
  - Attend a Sprint Review – The Customer agrees that they will provide the necessary attendees for the Sprint Review to allow a Review regarding What has been created and not, Progress towards the Product Goal, Likely release dates, Budget and Progress.

Perhaps we need to look at an early conversation with customers around a working agreement to understand the tradeoffs and ramifications…
