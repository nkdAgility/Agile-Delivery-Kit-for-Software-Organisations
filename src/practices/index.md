Additional practices, or stratagies, are an important part this organisations DNA. The right practices will emerge over time, this means that while a practice may work today it may not work that well tomorrow. You will need to adapt, add, and create new strategies.

Not all practices work for all teams and finding the most effective bundle for any given moment is an art form. These practices represent both core practices that we are all alligned on, and complimentery pratcices that context driven.
