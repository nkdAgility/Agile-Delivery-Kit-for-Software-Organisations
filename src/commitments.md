These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their
Stakeholders.



## Product Backlog

 – Owned by the Product Owner and provides Transparency of the future value
o	Product Goal as a Commitment - The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define "what" will fulfil the Product Goal. The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfil (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next.
•	Sprint Backlog – Owned by the Delivery Team and provides Transparency of the present in-flight value
o	Sprint Goal as a Commitment – The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives
•	 Increment – Owned by the Scrum Team and provides Transparency of the past value delivered
o	Definition of Done as a Commitment – The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.
