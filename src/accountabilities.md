For your to be successful there are a number of accountability's that need to be fulfilled. These accountability's can be shared, or fulfilled by a single person, but they must be distinct and be implemented.

## Organisational Services

There are clear accountabilities that are required for the smooth functioning of Agility within [Company] for each of the groups:

- **SDK Steward** – Is accountable for maintaining and supporting the [Company] Way, and for everyone's understanding of it.

## Practice Leadership Team(s)

The Practice Leadership Team(s) provide the actionable and empirical change leadership required to remove any organisational impediments to value delivery of the Delivery Team(s):

- **The Practice Leadership Team** - is accountable for creating a valuable, useful organisational change every Sprint.
- **Practice Owner** – Accountable for maximising the value of the changes and for effective Change Backlog management; e.g. Developing and explicitly communicating the Organisational  Goal; Creating and clearly communicating Change Backlog items; Ordering Change Backlog items; and, Ensuring that the Change Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.
- **Practitioners** - Accountable for Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog; Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done; Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and, Holding each other accountable as professionals.
- **Practice Coach** - accountable for establishing Agility as defined in the Agility Guide and the Agility Team's effectiveness

## Delivery Team(s)

The entire Delivery Team is accountable for *effectively creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint*. Scrum defines three specific accountabilities within the Delivery Team: the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master. 

The following accountabilities have been adapted from the latest version of the Scrum Guide and are what we would recommend that [Company] consider in terms of the roles fulfilled within Delivery Teams working on 'true' Agile engagements. They reflect the realities of working with and for customers of varying degrees of Agility.

- **The Scrum Team** - is accountable for effectively creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint.
  - **Product Owner** – Accountable for maximising the value of the product and for effective Product Backlog management; e.g. Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal; Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items; Ordering Product Backlog items; and, Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.
    - **Role: Product Owner (Customer)** – This is a representative of the customer that should fulfil the accountabilities listed above.
    - **Role: Product Owner Coach ([Company])** – Helps a good Product Owner become a great Product Owner and fills the gap when the customer is unable to fulfil. Additional accountability to [Company] to escalate any inadequacy in Product Ownership.
   - **Developers** – Accountable for Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog; Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done; Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and, Holding each other accountable as professionals.
      - **Role: Developers** – Including but not exclusive to coders, testers, business analysts, architects, solution architects, etc.
      - **Role: Integration Team** – When multiple teams are working together, there is additional accountability for integration assigned to a virtual group of the right people for the identified impediment.
  - **The Scrum Master** - accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide and the Scrum Team's effectiveness
- **Customer Account Manager** – Accountable to [Company] for any reporting required internally to validate the status of the account and budget with the customer.
- **Delivery Manager** – When a single group of Developers needs to work on multiple small projects at once the Delivery Manager coordinates the work between the different Product Owner/Customer Account Manager and shields the Delivery Team from those complexities.
