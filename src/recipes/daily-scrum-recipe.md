During the Daily Scrum, the Developers should be actively managing their work that is in progress. They should be discussing what they need to do next to be most effective at reaching the Sprint Goal.

There is no key way to do this, however, it is important to understand and look at the age of each of the work items that are currently in progress.

#Overview of Flow for Daily Scrum

This workshop leverages a simple flow and consists of the following:

The Developers review their progress towards the Sprint Goal. They should actively manage the work that is in progress and maintain transparency of the present as reflected in the Sprint Backlog. 

_Although Scrum Masters can certainly facilitate the Daily Scrum, it should be the Developers that own this event and facilitate it.;_

##Suggested Flow Steps

###Part 1: Review the Work in Process [~5 mins]

The Developers should review the work that is currently underway and identify any problems, issues, or missing information that is required to get to the Sprint Goal.

####Facilitation Options

- **Work Item Aging Graph** - A very effective way to review the work that is in progress is to use a Work Item Aging graph and to pay particular attention to the oldest items.

By actively managing the age of items the Developers can see clearly which items need the most focus, what is blocked, and how long they have been running.
- **Review the Boards** - Another key visualization is of the work currently in progress using a Board that shows the progress of the Value.

###Part 2: Create Actionable Plan for 24h [~10 min]

The outcome of the Daily Scrum should be an increase in the transparency of the work underway and this should be reflected in the Sprint Backlog. What is the plan for the next 24h and does the Sprint Backlog still represent the most important work to get to the Sprint Goal.

####Facilitation Options
