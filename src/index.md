This kit provides examples and suggestions  of the [strategies](./strategies/), [recipes](./recipes/). [workshops](./workshops/), [technologies](./technologies/), [practices](./practices/), and [guides](./guides/) that will help you be successful. Where posable these pages will use the terminology from the [guides](./guides/) referenced here. 

To enable the offer we have use these catagories to group the relevant content:

-   **Strategies** - a plan of action designed to achieve a long-term or overall aim
-   **Recipes** - a set of instructions which are likely to lead to a particular outcome
-   **Technologies** - the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes
-   **Practices** - the actual application or use of an idea, belief, or method, as opposed to theories relating to it
-   **Guides** - These guides are published and recognized guides to a topic.

## How to use this content

This content represents a starting point, or SDK, to help organisations kickstart creating their own way-of-working based on emergent lean-agile practices.

All of this content represents a baseline starting point for any Product delivery team or organisation. You can modify as needed within the bounds of your business context without breaking the core mindset.

If you would like to create your own copy of this SDK we recommend that you [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) on GitHub so that you can continue to pull new changes and updates to the content.

Our best efforts have been made, rather than to dictate, to create a balance between autonomy required for self-management, and alignment required to maintain our business. In service to that we try to uphold the following values in all aspects of our work: **Courage**, **Focus**, **Commitment**, **Openness**, & **Respect**

We recommend that you always question the content here, and always ask if you can do something easier and simpler. 

If so, do that!

## Way of Working & First Principals

Creating a collaborative, decentralized, and democratized way-of-working is an important part of developing a process and you should involve everyone that you expect to use it. People will not buy into your process unless its their process too. We operate in a highly competative and dynamic market 

he first key understanding is that there are no companies left that are in low competition markets with few customer demands. Those complicated markets have not existed since the 70s and all companies today have to deal with highly competitive markets with high customer demand and churn.

These core first principals, routed in empiricism, are at the heart of this document:
