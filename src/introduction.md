** Courage | Focus | Commitment | Openness | Respect **

Our best efforts have been made, rather than to dictate, to create a balance between autonomy required for self-management, and alignment required to maintain our business. [Always question the content here! Always!](#communities-%26-contributing) 


The first decision that needs to be made is [Should we use Agile or Traditional Practices](/Should-we-use-Agile-or-Traditional-Practices?). To do that you need to decide what sort of work you are working on. If the work that you have is in Simple or Complicated environments, it is suitable to use traditional practices like PMI or Prince2. If your work is in a Complex or Chaotic environment then you should use an Empirical system like Scrum or Kanban.

# Product Delivery

In the Product Delivery world, we operate in a complicated environment where we deliver many easily understood items to the customer; the outcome is known. This may be Support Tickets, a Software Factory, or another pre-built system that we are deploying or configuring. For this type of work, we should follow [flow-based techniques](/Guides/Kanban-Guide) to model our current process, and then optimise for output; more stuff. 

**Risk Management:** Risk here is managed by more control; lists of risks and mitigating actions.

**Techniques:** [flow-based techniques](/Guides/Kanban-Guide.md) complimented at scale with PMI / Prince2 / Plan-Driven

# Product Development

If we are building something that does not exist yet (all Software Engineering exists here!) then we are in a complex environment and need to use an empirical approach. Implementing an Empirical Process Control System requires transparency. Transparency is required to Inspect and Adapt our work.

We expect that you will use [Scrum](/Guides/Scrum-Guide.md) to manage the work, [Nexus](/Guides/Nexus-Framework.md) to manage many teams work, and [Evidence-based Management](/Guides/Evidence-Based-Management-Guide.md) to monitor your progress.

**Risk Management:** Delivery of [Done](/Core-Practices/Definition-of-Done-\(DoD\)) increments of value every Sprint including the first.

**Techniques:** Empirical techniques complemented by [Kanban](/Guides/Kanban-Guide.md)
