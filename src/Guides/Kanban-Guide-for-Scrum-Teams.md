## Purpose
The flow-based perspective of Kanban can enhance and complement the Scrum framework and its implementation. Teams can add complementary Kanban practices whether they are just starting to use Scrum or have been using it all along.
The Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams is the result of a collaboration between members of the Scrum.org community and leaders of the Kanban community. Together, they stand behind The Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams. It is their shared belief that professional product development practitioners can benefit from the application of Kanban together with Scrum.

## Relation to the Scrum Guide

This guide does not replace or discount any part of [The Scrum Guide](/Project-Management/Agile-Ways-of-Working/Guides-&-WhitePapers/Scrum-Guide). It is designed to enhance and expand the practices of Scrum. This guide assumes the reader is operating a process using the Scrum framework. Therefore, [The Scrum Guide](/Project-Management/Agile-Ways-of-Working/Guides-&-WhitePapers/Scrum-Guide) applies in its entirety.
