STEPS

- (3 min) Individually, generate one or more 15% Solutions;
- (15 min) In groups of 2-4, invite people to take turns to share their 15% Solutions;
- Optionally, collect the 15% Solutions somewhere;

TIPS

- If stakeholders struggle with coming up with things they can do to, emphasize that a 15% Solution can also be about sharing an idea they have, inviting others to join the next Sprint Review or being available for feedback during the Sprint;
