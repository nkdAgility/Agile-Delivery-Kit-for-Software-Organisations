## Agile Delivery Kit for Software Organisations

This content represents a starting point, or SDK, to help organisations kickstart creating their own way-of-working based on emergent lean-agile practices.

All of this content represents a baseline starting point for any Product delivery team or organisation. You can modify as needed within the bounds of your business context without breaking the core mindset.

>   Rules are for the guidance of wise people and the obedience of fools -Adam Cogan

### To run locally

To host a version of the site locally and valaidate a local build, or just to see how your new content fits then you need to run it in Jekyll. To do so:

- [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `Jekyll Serve`

If you are just editing a markdown file then you likley dont need this step.
